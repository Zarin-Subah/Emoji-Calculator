# Emoji-Calculator
This calculator is a normal emoji based calculator where I used PHP 8

The main branch has the step by step code i wrote and the development branch has the final version of code with comments 

At first you need to download the code files as a zip folder from git

You can download from the main branch or from the dvelopment branch 

If you want to understand the code then you need to download it from development because here you can find comment 

After Downloading the zip file you need to unzip the folder

Then you need Xampp or other software where you can run the code on php surver

You need to put the folder on Xampp htdoc folder 

Then You need to start the apache server from Xampp 

and then You will see the emoji calculator

Now you can give two numbers and choose emoji to calculate 

Then you will find the result
